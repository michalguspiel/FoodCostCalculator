# Information 
It is my first android project as well as programming project in general. In total I'd estimate that I have spent around 300 hours on it, I learned a lot and I'm going to keep improving my knowledge with diffrent projects. I am aware that this project has plenty of things to refactor, like organization of database and I'm going to fix it when I'll have time.

This projects is made with:
- MVVM architecture 
- Room database
- Shared preferences
- Fragments
- Dialog fragments
- Recycler Views
- List Views
