# FoodCostCalculator
Ultimate food cost calculator for chefs, freelancing caterers or anyone who need to calculate real
cost of their dishes. User needs to input products information with their data(price, waste percent,
tax), based on those products user can make dishes or half products which can be used in dishes.
Half products are ingredients that contain another ingredients, let's say we use in our restaurant
same marinated shrimp in two different dishes eg. Shrimp marinated in soy sauce, sesame oil, chilli
and garlic. We can create our half productModel as Marinated shrimp input all of ingredients for it
and then re-use it in dishes to calculate food cost . App supports metric and basic US system units.
Please send suggestions / opinions.
